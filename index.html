            <p>Land surveying is one of the oldest professions in the world—evidence of land surveys has been found in ancient Egypt, dating back over 3,000 years! The Egyptians used basic geometry to re-establish farm boundaries after the Nile River's annual floods, and even the Great Pyramid of Giza owes its precise alignment to early surveying methods.</p>

                    <h3>Construction Surveys</h3>
                    <p>Construction surveying involves transferring the design data from plans onto the ground so that builders, and contractors can construct buildings, roads, bridges, pipelines, and other infrastructure accurately according to specifications.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Setting out:</strong> Marking the exact positions of structures, such as buildings, roads, columns, foundations, and utilities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Level control:</strong> Establishing reference points (benchmarks) to ensure correct elevations and gradients.</li>
                        <li><strong>Alignment checks:</strong> Verifying that structures are built in the right location, alignment, and orientation.</li>
                        <li><strong>As-built surveys:</strong> Measuring and recording the completed work to confirm that construction matches the design - often required for project handover.</li>
