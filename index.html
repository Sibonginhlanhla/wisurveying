            <p>Land surveying is one of the oldest professions in the world—evidence of land surveys has been found in ancient Egypt, dating back over 3,000 years! The Egyptians used basic geometry to re-establish farm boundaries after the Nile River's annual floods, and even the Great Pyramid of Giza owes its precise alignment to early surveying methods.</p>
